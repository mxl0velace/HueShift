# HueShift
Colour beyond words, hue beyond you.

Colour and social inclusion are the name of the game at HueHacks, so what better than socially-decided colours? Social media can go beyond words, giving us the ability to share our feelings in hues.

HueShift is a social media site, where each post gets coloured based on user votes. Each post, or piece, then becomes a collaborative artwork - the content is decided by the artist, but the framing (colour) depends on how the audience sees it.
